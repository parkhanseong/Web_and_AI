CSS Precedence Rules
When the browser needs to resolve what styles to apply to a given HTML element, it uses a set of CSS precedence rules.
 Given these rules, the browser can determine what styles to apply. The rules are:

!important after CSS properties.
Specificity of CSS rule selectors.
Sequence of declaration.
I will explain what these rules mean in the following sections.

Note, that CSS precedence happens at CSS property level. 
Thus, if two CSS rules target the same HTML element, and the first CSS rule takes precedence over the second, 
then all CSS properties specified in the first CSS rule takes precedence over the CSS properties declared in the second rule. 
However, if the second CSS rule contains CSS properties that are not specified in the first CSS rule, 
then these are still applied. The CSS rules are combined - not overriding each other.
